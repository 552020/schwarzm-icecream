# Ice cream tracker with Create React App

Finally a DIY (not coding along) create-react-app react-mini-app as a project for the React Udemy Course of Mr. Schwarzm√ºller.

The project was about to build an app to display the name and the age added by the user.
But an ice tracker felt more suited to the seasons to me.
